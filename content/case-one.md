-   Data presentation
-   Data acquistion
-   Data manipulation

Over the past half a year I found myself in a ideal learning enviroment. Working with marketing data on a developing team. It is almost a law at this point that the digital space moves at breakneck speed. Leading to heaps of jargan, processes and methods for driving toward the equalibrium between stability to build and change in order to stay competitive.
The processes in the marketing space are no different. I found myself in a mix of old, new, and some down right ugly processes and a heap of techical and business constraints. The first step in my process is to emerse myself in  a system, wonder anound abit. A little curiosity, letting my nose guide me. Asking questions when the questions were knocking.
After a few month I felt like I had a good handle on what our chanlenge looked like. It turned out to be three related yet distint problems.
1. Efficinet data acquisition
2. Effictive and dynamic data manipulation
3. Data and result presentation in the format that our stakeholder either wanted to see or expected to see.
