# Project Journal

I figured I might as well use this opportunity to work through a bit of the thoughts associated with this rgiamarole.

Ummm.... lets start with some bullets.

A minimum viable product. The concept of an mvp is a more difficult practice and nuanced then I had prvioously thought. Working on this project I found that my mvp kept being blocked by one thing or another. I guess to clairify, I needed the project shipped to apply for jobs or at least have a better shot. But every day/week that I let the project live in stagging. I became more and more stressed and frusturated.

There are a few moves here. One reevaluate the resouces involved. Look at all of the subprojects.
1. Can they be reworked a same same but different version
2. Can a sub project be rescoped to a smaller  more completable version
3. Should  subprojects be dropped

This last one, makes the mvp much smaller but in my situation I have to have this out and the other components. Are taking too much time.
