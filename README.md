This is a data portfolio version 1.0 and a example of "shipping beats perfection". I have only just stated my career in data analytics. I hope this showcases some of my skill and where I am going.

### Refections

This is just another project that required me to "get it done" do to one enviromental constraint or another. With each one of these experiences I find my abiltiy to redefine my scope as I discover that one objective or another requires more resource then available. My abilty to pivot and ship is increasing and I am excite to see how this skill matures.
