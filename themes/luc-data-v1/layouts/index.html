            <h5 class="">
              Â I have always been a problem solver. When I was young, I would deconstruct origami and figure out how a piece was made. This curiosity lead me to the study of maths because of the power of the tool. This same line of thought is what
              brought me to programming as code gives legs to any analysis.

              <p>
                We were pulling analytics data from three data sources with inconsistent properties and data types. The previous solution was to manually clean and adjust properties with excel.
              </p>
              <h4 class="color-d">Solutions</h4>
              <p>
                Created a bit of script with python and pandas that cleaned and created homogenous properties and data types from each data source. Resulting in more accurate analysis and increased band width.
              </p>
              <p class="color-grey-ll">
                Ideally much of the preprocessing could be handled programmatically with an API integration but for business reason this has not been fully adopted.

                We had a corse set of report that semi automated through excel functions. As the data sets we were working with were already pushing Excel upper bound. The macros were erroring out or dropped data.

              </p>
              <h4 class="color-d">Solutions</h4>
              <p>
                Consolidated three of our course Excel based reports into python and pandas. Reducing reporting time by 70%.
