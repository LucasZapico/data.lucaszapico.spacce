               I have always been a problem solver. When I was young, I would deconstruct origami and figure out how a piece was made. This curiosity lead me to the study of maths because of the power of the tool. This same line of thought is what
              brought me to programming as code gives legs to any analysis.

                We were pulling analytics data from three data sources with inconsistent properties and data types. The previous solution was to manually clean and adjust properties.

                Created a bit of script with pandas that cleaned and created homogenous properties and data types. This resulted in more accurate analysis and increased band width.

                Ideally much of the preprocessing could be handled programmatically with an API intergration but for business reason this has not been fully adopted
