            <h5 class="">In The Beginning</h5>
            <p>
               I have always been a problem solver. When I was young, I would deconstruct origami and figure out how a piece was made. My process has only matured since then. The core system is the same. Stretch and explore the space touch the
              limitation of the elements on the board and discuss and fail quickly. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="">Past</h5>
            <p>
                     I studied maths and economics in academia but left without completing my major at UCLA. I burned out from a nieve workload, trying to complete a master in maths, and a bachelor's in economics in three years. The experience was
              one of the most difficult and eye-opening of my life. Due to the consequences of those choices, I have grit and perspective that I am not sure I would have found otherwise. It is very much on my life list to finish my majors.     
            </p>
            <h5 class="">Recent Past</h5>
            <p>
                     I have always had a natural appreciation and inclination for design. So, after leaving school in 2016, I was able to get into a development firm doing there user interface and user experience design. I owned design iterations on
              seven products during my year and a half there. To me, design is just a different type of problem. I then did a stint of freelance work doing branding, marketing, and design during which time I did a deep dive into web development. I
              used said skills to build this here website.  :)   
            </p>

            <h5 class="">Presentist</h5>
            <p>
              Since February 2019, I took the opportunity to move back into something a bit more analytic and have been a marketing analyst specializing in Microsoft Bing platform. Due to Bing rapid growth over the last five years, I found myself
              working with processes and tools that were very much still iterating. As such, it was a perfect opportunity to start acquiring the beginning of a data science tool kit. I leveraged a bit of mental muscle developed through my maths and
              a budding computer science foundation to hop into python, pandas, and matplotlib. The data analyst tool kid did not disappoint. I have called out a few business solutions that though somewhat trivial, made a massive difference in my
              day to day workflow.

                We were pulling analytics data from three data sources with inconsistent properties and data types. The previous solution was to manually clean and adjust properties.

                Created a bit of script with pandas that cleaned and created homogenous properties and data types. This resulted in more acturate analysis and increased band width.
