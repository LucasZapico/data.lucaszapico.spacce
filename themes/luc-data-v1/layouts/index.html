      I use creativy and a love of problems to tell the stories of data</h1>
      <h4 class="color-d">I love discussing, playing with and solving problems of all shape size. I am drawn to the digital space because of the speed of iteration and the seemingly infinite opportunites to do more (little mircosoft ;)). My todo list
