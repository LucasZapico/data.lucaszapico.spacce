          <p>
            I have always been a problem solver. When I was young, I would deconstruct oragami and figure out how a piece was made. My problemm solving process has only matured since then. The core system is the same. Emerser youself in the space. I
            studied maths and econmics in academia but had to leave due to personal reasons. It is very much a priority to
            coomplete
            my degree once a career is stablized.

            Upon leaving school in 2016 I had to figure out how to add value. I found myself in doing application design and user experience design. I had always had an eye for design as good design and an efficient solution are one and the same in
            my mind.

            Since Feburary 2019 I have been a marketing analyist specializing in Microsoft Bing platform. Due to Bing rapid growth over the last five years I found myself working with processes and tools that were still maturing. As such it was a
            perfect opportunity to start acquiring the begining of a data science tool kit. I took my past experience with web development and hopped into python, pandas and matplotlib and I was not disappointed.

          <h4>Friction Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We were pulling analytics data from three data sources with inconsistent properties and data types. The previous solution was excel based...enough said.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Solutions</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Created a script that cleaned and created homogenous properties and data types. This resulted in more acturate analysis and increased band width for higher congnitive tasks.
